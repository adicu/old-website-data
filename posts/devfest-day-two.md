### 03 Feb 2014

It was a snowy day in Morningside Heights yesterday but everyone at DevFest stayed warm with Hunan Chen&#8217;s in their bellies and free Venmo swag on their backs!

A brief summary in pictures:

During yesterday&#8217;s workshop, superman Dan [introduced Flask](http://adicu.com/intro-webdev/) to hackers of all levels.

Speaking of hackers of all levels, here are blurbs written by some friendly faces we saw at the workshop. We&#8217;re hoping to introduce you to other DevFest-ers so you can find them to hack together or just to say hi.

> Hey, my name is Hank Shorb, and I&#8217;m a sophomore in SEAS studying applied math. I first got introduced to computer science at the beginning of my freshman year here and became interested immediately. Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve only gotten the chance to take one compsci course since getting here, and I would really like to learn more. I&#8217;m hoping DevFest will allow me to expand my knowledge of computer science and get me to the point where I can create a piece of code that functions in the real world as opposed to only inside of a homework submission.

> My name is Sagar Shah and I am a first year MBA student at Columbia Business School. As a former electrical engineering undergrad looking to rejuvinate his programming skills, I have found DevFest to be quite useful. The hope is to take these skills and launch one of several ventures I have in the works. It would also be great to increase collaboration between the business school and the engineering school to help match ventures with the right talent.

> My name is Gracie Gilbert, I am a sophomore in CC and plan to major in CS. After this semester I will have finished all but one class of the core CS classes but I still don&#8217;t really feel like I know much about building web apps or even things that are useful on a day to day basis, which is why I decided to do DevFest this year. Hopefully I get a lot better at Python as well.

More posts with more friendly faces will appear soon! Don&#8217;t forget to check the website for updates and we hope to see you at Intro to APIs!
