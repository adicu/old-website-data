### 02 Apr 2013

_Check out ADI member Christian Moscardi&#8217;s story of his experience as a newbie developer at hackNY. Hope to see y&#8217;all there this weekend!_

I went to my first hackNY in the fall of 2011. I wasn&#8217;t too serious about it&#8212;I figured I&#8217;d go and check out what all the buzz was about. That said, I was nervous, a bit uncomfortable, and certainly out of my element, when I arrived. I stepped into the packed auditorium at the Courant Institute and saw virtually every single person with a laptop out. Feeling uncool with mine in my backpack, I sat down ASAP next to some coders who, due to black screens with green text, looked _really hardcore_ to me&#8212;and pulled out my Dell, running Windows 7 at the time. My screen wasn&#8217;t black&#8212;and while Linux was on my radar, I had pretty much no idea that Windows and web development just don&#8217;t go that great together.

The API demos were a blur. I had taken 1004 at the time, and while I understood at a high level what was going on and had even fiddled with HTTP, I had pretty much no idea what was going on. Who was this &#8220;Jason&#8221; everybody was talking about? Endpoints? API Keys? Yeah&#8212;definitely not old hat for me.

As the demos ended, I fortunately bumped into someone I recognized and started chatting with him (_read_: I followed him because I had no idea where to go). This turned out well, as he led me to the &#8220;Columbia room&#8221;&#8212;i.e. the place where all the Columbia students had set up shop to begin working on projects. Luckily for me, another upperclassman took me under his wing and let me listen to his team&#8217;s brainstorming. They ended up coming up with a cool concept, and I felt really cool being able to contribute (at a very high level) to the discussion.

Additionally, given my utter lack of web development knowledge (seriously, aside from HTML/CSS we&#8217;re talking nothing), hearing words like &#8220;Node.JS&#8221; thrown out actually gave me great Google-fodder and things to do while I tried to follow the discussion, which was quickly becoming more and more technical. Within a couple of hours I headed out, but even doing nothing felt like I had just opened a door into something completely new. I&#8217;m really grateful toward that upperclassman for including me in his group&#8212;in general, I&#8217;ve been amazed by how open and welcoming the community around HackNY is.

I picked up Rails over the winter, and came to that spring&#8217;s hackNY with not just more skills, but a couple of ideas. The first was the slightly half-baked Poopsquare, which used Foursquare and specifically dealt with choice nearby bathrooms. The other was something involving cats and dating. Incidentally, a friend had a similar idea to the latter, and when we both realized this, meowspace was born. It was a silly, dead simple site, but it was something, and more important, we finished and demo&#8217;d (though I regret it, I have to admit that I returned to Columbia that night). I remember being so invigorated when I pushed that last bugfix to Heroku and we finally had a working site. The feeling of accomplishment was absolutely awesome. We built this thing in a night!

This Saturday, I&#8217;ll be attending my third hackNY (I was abroad last semester). I now know python. I can use an API. I can put up a website reasonably quickly. This year, HackNY is at Columbia&#8212;home turf for me. I don&#8217;t have an idea yet, but something will be happening. More important, show up and make something of your own happen!
