### 24 Jan 2014

As an organization, ADI values sharing digital literacy and teaching others to use technology to build both in and out of the Columbia community. It&#8217;s why our founder, Ryan Bubinski, founded [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/): he wanted to teach the world to code. Most of our educational efforts happen in and around Columbia, but every once in a while we like to pop the Morningside bubble.

Last academic year, a group of 15 ADI members gave up their spring breaks (while they could have been relaxing at the beach) to run an after-school camp for the mentees of [Project Rousseau](http://projectrousseau.org/). These students got a chance to learn basic programming skills, and walked away from the week with their very own web sites, which they demoed at Facebook&#8217;s New York offices during a site visit.

## Isaac Newton Middle School

In 2013-2014, ADI began to expand our outreach into a longer-term program at [Isaac Newton Middle School](http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/04/M825/default.htm) in East Harlem. We sent students to teach a once-a-week programming curriculum that we developed ourselves to about 30 students during the spring semester. In this coming semester, we plan to work more closely with the students who were the most excited about this program to develop their technical skills.

## The World Outside of Morningside

ADI&#8217;s goal of creating a developer community extends beyond campus: it&#8217;s important to our members that everyone, no matter what their background, understand the important role technology plays in the world today and how they can use it to their benefit. We look forward to continuing to expand out community outreach programs in the future.
