Congratulations Columbia hackers for being [named the 2nd best school](http://mlh.io/blog/standings-are-live-10-02-2013/) for hacking by Major League Hackers! Columbia has been rocking it in terms of attendance at hackathons recently (PennApps, MHacks, and HackNY so far) and especially in terms of winners.

Some Columbia winners at HackNY:

*   Zack Newman (1st place)
*   Chris Yan, Brian Shin, and Nate Brennand (Most Technically Challenging)
*   Justin Zhao, Lisa Li, and Michael Saltzman (Funniest).

We hope this streak will continue at HackMIT and HackRU, and that newbies and pros alike will head out and represent!

PSA: If you are ever looking to meet partners and teamates, come to Cookies and Code on Wednesday nights at 10pm in Lerner 569 to mingle.
