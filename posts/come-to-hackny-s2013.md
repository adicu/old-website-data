hackNY organizes once-a-semester student 'hackathons': 24-hour coding
    events in which NYC startups present their technologies and students build
    original applications based on them. Winning teams have presented at the
    New York Tech Meetup. The seventh hackathon will be the spring 2013 hackNY
    student hackathon, April 6-7, 2012. Students are encouraged to sign up via
    [hackerleague.org](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/spring-2013-hackny-student-hackathon) and startups are encouraged to sign up for the hackNY news
    for announcements about how to get involved. This year it will be hosted at
    Columbia for the first time, so come out and show us what you've got!
