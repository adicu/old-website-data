### 14 Oct 2013

Last Monday (2013-10-07), we had an all-star cast of YC affiliates talk about Katamari Damacy, mistakes they&#8217;ve made, how to get the most out of your university education, and why _you_ should consider entrepreneurship as an alternative to a traditional career.

Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t have pictures, but we filled Pupin 301 to the brim. Check out the speakers here:
