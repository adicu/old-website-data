### 08 Feb 2014

And what a week it&#8217;s been!

After quite a few amazing tech companies demo-ed their APIs on Friday evening, the hackathon part of DevFest began (cue gong here). Dinner was consumed&#8230;

&#8230; and the hacking began! Shoutout to all the ADI sandwich makers who provided happiness to everyone at midnight.

At noon Saturday, the caffeinated (thanks Red Bull and 5-hour Energy!) hackers piled into Havemeyer 309 to demo their last 16 hours&#8217; worth of sweat and tears. Hacks included everything from finding free study space at Columbia to playing a variably fierce Beyonce song on any phone. The winners after demo-ing are:
