It&#8217;s that time of the year &#8212; DevFest is fast approaching!!

For those of you who have been living under a rock for the past few years, DevFest is ADI&#8217;s biggest and most important event of the year. At ADI, we find it really important to create a community of builders and teach people who aren&#8217;t builders to not be afraid to try. Thus, DevFest was born in 2011.

What does &#8220;DevFest&#8221; even mean? We don&#8217;t really know (we tried looking in a dictionary too, but it&#8217;s not there). Like with most other things, we took a few creative liberties and made DevFest up. We do, however, know that DevFest will be a lot of fun. It&#8217;s a weeklong event for anyone who&#8217;s in a programming class but hasn&#8217;t built a web app before. But more than that, it&#8217;s like a hackathon++ that&#8217;s suitable for everyone&#8212;in addition to hacking, there will be workshops, beautiful individuals from ADI to look to for help, free swag, and lots of free food (emphasis on food).

Now that you&#8217;re thoroughly excited, clear your calendars from Feb. 1-8 and get ready to learn, build and demo. Register at [devfe.st](http://devfe.st) and on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/253467928147545/) to join the 500+ other cool kids in this amazing experience. We hope to see you there!!!
