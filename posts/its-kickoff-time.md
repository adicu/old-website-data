### 01 Feb 2014

DevFest hath begun!!

For all the shameful individuals who&#8217;ve missed the memo, we kicked off DevFest yesterday in the Davis Auditorium in CEPSR! By the time DevFest officially started at noon, more than 800 people registered online. Despite all the brochures we had to fold to accommodate for such large company, we were glad to see so many of your faces there.

After everyone ate lunch and mingled briefly, Zack Newman and Dan Schlosser made notable speeches to officially welcome everyone to a wonderful week of hacking.

Shortly after, Pitchfest and environment setup began (if you would still like to set up your environment, visit Sidharth Shanker&#8217;s [hard work](http://squidarth.github.io/Devfest-Environment-Setup/)).

For those who needed a crash course or a review on Python, we also held an Introduction to Python session while open hacking was occurring in the afternoon. The schedule for the rest of the week, which will be updated as it is subject to change, can be found [here](http://adicu.com/devfest/).

Thanks to everyone who attended kickoff. We can&#8217;t wait to spend more time than necessary with all of you throughout the rest of this week!
