### 04 Feb 2014

Yesterday was the fourth day of DevFest and we had such a great time introducing you all to APIs. Shoutout to Bloomberg for sponsoring us, providing us with free swag and volunteering to TA!

As promised, we have more interviews with wide-eyed DevFest-ers to share with you all. Thankfully, they were all sweet and sane people:

> My name is Lance Legel, and I&#8217;m a masters student in CS. At DevFest we have a team of five masters students, all CS, and we also have an undergraduate who&#8217;s just getting involved. Two of us are working on the UI. I&#8217;ve never done any web or Javascript before in my life. It&#8217;s a true hack; we&#8217;re just going with the flow. What we do know are some really advanced analytics, so we&#8217;ve hacked into Wikipedia right now and we&#8217;re just building this amazing user interface to try to give a unique education experience that recommends what articles might be interesting. I&#8217;m really excited about the user interface. We&#8217;re basically going to have lots of fun &#8212; we love the food, we&#8217;re very grateful &#8212; we love the energy and we enjoy meeting people. DevFest just represents a great synergy of vision and talent and fun. It&#8217;s really cool stuff.

> I&#8217;m Miranda Li. My experience with computer science started in high school. I&#8217;m only a freshman in CC so I took Intro to Comp Sci and I&#8217;m taking Data Structures right now. I haven&#8217;t been to a hackathon before and so I really wanted to make something even if it&#8217;s only to start and see what I can do in such a short span of time. I want to get better at useful, practical computer science and I think DevFest will really help me. I went to the Python workshop on Saturday and I thought it was really helpful. With the online tutorials, I could follow along and learn it myself. I have no idea what I want to develop yet. Kanika and I are still deciding!

> Hi, I&#8217;m Kanika Verma and I&#8217;m also a freshman in CC. I did AP Comp Sci my senior year of high school and I took 1004 last semester. I&#8217;m doing Data Structures this semester. I just wanted to get more experience doing computer science outside of class, which I haven&#8217;t really done a lot of before. Like Miranda said, I wanted to do my first hackathon. I really appreciate the workshops and things that are aimed at beginnners. It&#8217;s kind of overwhelming at first to get started on this sort of stuff so I really appreciate that it&#8217;s friendly for someone who doesn&#8217;t know that much. At DevFest we&#8217;re just trying to make something simple and useful.

Another notable quote was &#8220;We love ADI because you feed us knowledge,&#8221; which was said to Dina by some unidentified DevFest-er. If you would like to claim that quote please let us identify you so we can give you a massive hug.
